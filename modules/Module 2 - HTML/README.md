module#2 html		est 60-90 min

1. open google drive account
	* "The first thing we need to do to build our webpage is find a place to put it. 
		That's why google drive is so important. With google drive we can save our files online and open them
		on any computer that is connected to the internet. Now to do this we have to make a new file on google 
		drive called my porfolio. In it we'll  save all the files that make up our website."
2. create index.html
	*"Let's open up a new file in our text editor and save it as an html file just like before"
3.explain tags
	*"Now, the problem with the hello world site we made before is we didn't use any html.
		We saved it as an html file. and the browser read it as an html document
		But we were missing the thing that makes html useful in the first place.
		I'm talking about tags. Think of tags as labels.Now can anyone tell me what we use labels for?
		one example might be at the grocery store. We use labels to tell the difference between two things
		and so we can keep them seperated.
 		for example how would we tell the difference between a jug of orange juice and a jug
		of orange hand soap without labels? taste it? I think i'd rather just use labels.
		So just like with the grocery store we need labels for everything in our website. 
		So that the browser can tell the difference between a picture and a paragraph and so we can 
		seperate an article about dogs from an article about cats  "

15. a brief speech on goal setting
	*"On our site there are sections for my goals and my plan. This is a very important concept. Even if after this class
	you decide that you never want to code again I want you to at least learn this. There is a huge difference
	between a dream and a goal.Anyone can dream and it's good to dream because dreams are where all good things start.
	But forget what you've heard on the disney channel.Dreams don't come true.Goals come true! A goal is a dream with
	a plan. and a plan is just a bunch of little goals or steps that will acomplish one big goal. So say our goal is to become
	a web developer, what would the first step be in our plan to become one? Learn how to use html! that's step one. So
	in your goals section I want you to tell us about something you want to do. Something you really want to accomplish
	Maybe it's to become a web developer or an astronaut or maybe it's something simple like
	learn to play guitar over the summer. It really doesn't matter what it is. Then I want you to make a plan about how your going to 
	do it. Remember nothing in this life is impossible if you set goals, plan ahead, and work hard.
	so that's enough for now we're going to take a few minutes to come around to look over your work so far. we'll
	answer any questions and help you with your goals and plans then we'll take a snack break before we start working
	with CSS."
